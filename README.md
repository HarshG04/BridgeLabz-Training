A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
Methods help in organizing code, improving readability, and promoting reusability.

### 🔹 Types of Methods
- **Void Methods**: Perform an action but do not return a value  
- **Return Type Methods**: Perform an action and return a value  
- **Methods with Parameters**: Accept input values to process data  
- **Methods without Parameters**: Execute tasks without external input

## 📅 Day 8 - 29 December 2025

### 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Learn how OOP improves code structure
- Relate OOP with previously learned C# concepts

### 📚 Introduction to OOP
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** organizes programs using **classes** and **objects**, making code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

### 🔹 Core OOP Concepts (Overview)
- **Class**: Blueprint that defines data and behavior
- **Object**: Instance of a class
- **Encapsulation**: Binding data and methods together
- **Abstraction**: Showing only essential details

### 🔗 Applying Previous Concepts in OOP
- Variables become **class fields**
- Methods become **class behaviors**
- Arrays and strings are handled inside classes
- Programs are structured into logical units

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- OOP improves code organization and readability
- Classes group related data and logic
- Solved scenario-based problems using previously learned concepts

---

## 📅 Day 9 - 30 December 2025

### 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand the concept of **constructors** in C#
- Learn the **basics and purpose** of constructors
- Identify different **types of constructors**
- Understand **objects and instances** in OOP

### 📚 Constructors Overview
A **constructor** is a special member of a class that is automatically invoked when an object is created.  
Its primary role is to **initialize class data members**.

### 🔹 Basics of Constructors
- Constructor name is the **same as the class name**
- It does **not return any value**
- It runs automatically during object creation
- Used to set initial values for fields

### 🔹 Types of Constructors
- **Default Constructor**: Initializes objects with default values  
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Initializes objects with user-defined values  
- **Constructor Overloading**: Multiple constructors with different parameters in the same class  

### 🔹 Objects and Instances
- A **class** is a blueprint
- An **object (instance)** is a real entity created from a class
- Each instance has its **own separate data**
- Constructors run once per object creation

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Constructors ensure objects start in a valid state
- They improve clarity, safety, and structure of code
- Constructor types offer flexibility in object creation
- Understanding instances is key to mastering OOP
